 This file implements a random data pool based on the use of an external
 entropy function.  It is based on the ideas advocated by Peter Gutmann in
 his work on pseudo random sequence generators.  It is not a 'paranoid'
 random sequence generator and no attempt is made to protect the pool
 from prying eyes either by memory locking or by techniques to obscure
 its location in memory.
